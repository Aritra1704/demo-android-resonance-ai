# demo-android-resonance-ai

This is Atooma Resonance AI demo app.  
External developers can clone this repo to have a quick starting app that let them play with Resonance Android SDK.  

Remember to put your project id and apikey in [resonance.properties](https://github.com/atooma/demo-android-resonance-ai/blob/master/app/src/main/assets/resonance.properties).

With this app you will be able to test [resonance dashboard console](https://console.atooma.com).  
You can create lua rules and push them to your app; this sample app is ready to receive your pushed rules.  
Moreover, this app has an integration fragment too, to enable third party services integrations.
